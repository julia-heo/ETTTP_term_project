Implementing Tic-Tac-Toe game with python.

We used python socket to implement tic-tac-toe game.

1. What is tic-tac-toe game?
   - Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a simple two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking a cell in the grid with their respective symbols, either "X" or "O". The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of one's own symbols. The game ends when one player achieves this goal or when all nine cells are filled without any player forming a line, resulting in a draw. Here's a brief overview of the rules and gameplay:
   -  <b>Grid Setup</b>: The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
   -   Players: There are two players. One uses "X" and the other uses "O".
   -   Turns: Players take turns to place their symbol in an empty cell.
   -   Winning: The first player to align three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
   -   Draw: If all nine cells are filled without either player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
   -   Tic-tac-toe is a straightforward game that is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching concepts of strategy and logic. It is easy to learn and can be played anywhere with just paper and pencil.
